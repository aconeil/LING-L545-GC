To run maxmatch.py the command line should look like:
$ python3 maxmatch.py ja_text.txt

where ja_text.txt represents a file of text that you wish to find maxmatch forms for. 

Additionally, you will need a file of possible forms to train the machine to find. In the code, this is labeled "ja-extracted.txt".
